/H/ YAGNI=> You Ain't going to need it
it is good to have seperate interfaces for the seperate functionalotity we may have a class whcih implements multiple interfaces, so lient is free tio implement one or more interface

//In the example Machine interface is not an good practise of programmint for following reason

2. if he wants to throw exception he needs to get hold of source code which he doesnt has
3. if he provides some random code or error message he still is giving user the option to use the method and break code
