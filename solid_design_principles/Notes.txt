//SRP- Single Responsibility  Principle
Every File or class must have a single purpose
In the Example Journal class is only responsible to add and remove journal and modify journal
It is not responible to do any other task like saving data to file leading data from file
this approach is called SRP

//Persistance class only does work related to persisting data
//journal class only does work related to adding and removing Journal
//maintaining a journal object
