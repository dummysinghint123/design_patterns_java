/h/ LSP-> Liskov substitution Principle
/s/ Invented by baber liskov 
It states that we must always be able to substitute a subclass for a base,
If an api takes a base class we must comforably able to pass the subclass into it without breaking it
we must always follow liskov Substitution principle

Means we must not override the default behavior of the base class in the subclass like it does addition in place of substraction and so on.
if in baseclass the expected behavior of the getName is to get the name of employee 
but in subclass we override it to get the name of dept this violates the LSP
//If we pass subclasss in place of base class it should now break in other areas or API's where we were using the base class
